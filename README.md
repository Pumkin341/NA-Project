# Computer graphics: curves created with spline functions
## **B-spline, Bezier-de Casteljau** 

This project involves developing a PyQt-based GUI application for visualizing and animating B-Spline and Bezier curves.


**Implemented Functionalities:**
    - Control Point Input: Allow users to input and edit control points.
    - Degree Specification: Allow users to specify the degree of the curve.
    - Knot Vector Generation: Generate or import knot vectors for B-Spline curves.
    - Curve Plotting: Plot B-Spline curves based on the control points and knot vectors.
                    Plot Bezier curves based on the control points.
    - Curve Interpolation: Interpolate curves.
    - Animation: Animate the B-Spline curve construction process.
    - Data Import: Import control points and knot vectors from text files.
                Import control points and knot vectors from JSON files.
    - Random Control Points:  Generate random control points for quick testing.
    - User Interaction: Provide a user-friendly interface with real-time updates and visual feedback.
